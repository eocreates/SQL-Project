💾 SQL Portfolio
----
This repository contains all my completed SQL projects, showcasing how I extract, clean, and analyze data to solve real-world business problems.

All projects were developed primarily using Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)  with queries easily adaptable to other SQL environments such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Azure SQL Database.

⚠ Note: Some SQL functions may vary across different database systems. If you’re using MySQL or PostgreSQL, be sure to confirm that syntax and function names align with your chosen environment.

Here are the types of projects you’ll find in this repository:
